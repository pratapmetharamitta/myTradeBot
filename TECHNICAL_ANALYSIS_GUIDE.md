# Technical Analysis Implementation Guide

## üî¨ Technical Indicators Deep Dive

### Bollinger Bands Implementation
```python
# 20-period Simple Moving Average with 2 Standard Deviations
Upper Band = SMA(20) + (2 √ó STD(20))
Middle Band = SMA(20)
Lower Band = SMA(20) - (2 √ó STD(20))
```

**Trading Signals:**
- **Oversold Buy**: Price ‚â§ Lower Band (High probability bounce)
- **Overbought Sell**: Price ‚â• Upper Band (Potential reversal)
- **Trend Following**: Price above/below Middle Band for directional bias

**Position Sizing Impact:**
- Near Lower Band: +20% position size, -40% profit requirement
- Near Upper Band: -30% position size, +40% profit requirement

### Fibonacci Retracement Levels
```python
# Key retracement levels from daily high/low
23.6% = High - (0.236 √ó (High - Low))
38.2% = High - (0.382 √ó (High - Low))
50.0% = High - (0.500 √ó (High - Low))
61.8% = High - (0.618 √ó (High - Low))
78.6% = High - (0.786 √ó (High - Low))
```

**Strategic Applications:**
- **Support Levels**: 38.2% and 61.8% as key support zones
- **Profit Taking**: Exit at 61.8% retracement with 5%+ gain
- **Entry Validation**: Strong support signals at golden ratio levels

---

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
```python
# 14-period RSI calculation
RS = Average Gain(14) / Average Loss(14)
RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))
```

**Signal Interpretation:**
- **RSI < 30**: Oversold condition (Buy signal)
- **RSI > 70**: Overbought condition (Sell signal)
- **RSI < 50**: Bearish momentum
- **RSI > 50**: Bullish momentum

**Strategy Integration:**
- Oversold signals receive +10% technical bonus
- Combined with other indicators for confluence

---

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
```python
# Standard MACD parameters (12, 26, 9)
MACD Line = EMA(12) - EMA(26)
Signal Line = EMA(9) of MACD Line
Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line
```

**Trading Signals:**
- **Bullish**: MACD > Signal AND Histogram > 0
- **Bearish**: MACD < Signal AND Histogram < 0
- **Momentum**: Histogram expansion/contraction

---

### Stochastic Oscillator
```python
# 14-period Stochastic calculation
%K = ((Close - Lowest Low(14)) / (Highest High(14) - Lowest Low(14))) √ó 100
%D = SMA(3) of %K
```

**Signal Generation:**
- **%K < 20**: Oversold (Buy signal)
- **%K > 80**: Overbought (Sell signal)
- **%K > %D**: Bullish momentum
- **%K < %D**: Bearish momentum

---

## üéØ Technical Scoring System

### Signal Strength Calculation
```python
signals = [bollinger, rsi, macd, stochastic, fibonacci, price_action]

buy_signals = count('buy', 'bullish', 'support' in signals)
sell_signals = count('sell', 'bearish', 'resistance' in signals)

if buy_signals >= 4:
    signal = 'strong_buy', confidence = 0.9
elif buy_signals >= 3:
    signal = 'buy', confidence = 0.7
elif sell_signals >= 4:
    signal = 'strong_sell', confidence = 0.9
elif sell_signals >= 3:
    signal = 'sell', confidence = 0.7
else:
    signal = 'neutral', confidence = 0.5
```

### Technical Bonus Scoring
- **Strong Buy**: +30% score bonus (confidence √ó 0.3)
- **Buy**: +20% score bonus (confidence √ó 0.2)
- **Specific Bonuses**:
  - Bollinger oversold: +10%
  - RSI oversold: +10%
  - Fibonacci strong support: +5%

## üìä Market Regime Adaptation

### Volatility-Based Parameter Adjustment

#### High Volatility (>3.5%)
```python
parameters = {
    'stop_loss_pct': 0.03,      # 3% stop loss
    'trailing_trigger': 1.12,    # 12% gain trigger
    'min_profit_pct': 0.008,     # 0.8% minimum profit
    'target_profit': 250         # $250 per trade target
}
```

#### Low Volatility (<1.5%)
```python
parameters = {
    'stop_loss_pct': 0.02,      # 2% stop loss
    'trailing_trigger': 1.04,    # 4% gain trigger
    'min_profit_pct': 0.002,     # 0.2% minimum profit
    'target_profit': 120         # $120 per trade target
}
```

#### Normal Market (1.5-3.5%)
```python
parameters = {
    'stop_loss_pct': 0.025,     # 2.5% stop loss
    'trailing_trigger': 1.08,    # 8% gain trigger
    'min_profit_pct': 0.004,     # 0.4% minimum profit
    'target_profit': 180         # $180 per trade target
}
```

## üîÑ Dynamic Position Sizing Algorithm

### Technical Confidence Scaling
```python
base_allocation = available_funds / num_positions

# Adjust based on technical signal strength
if signal == 'strong_buy':
    target_profit *= 1.5
    allocation_pct = 0.6
elif signal == 'buy':
    target_profit *= 1.2
    allocation_pct = 0.5
else:
    allocation_pct = 0.4

# Calculate position size
shares = min(
    int(target_profit / profit_per_share),
    int(base_allocation * allocation_pct / entry_price)
)
```

### Risk-Adjusted Constraints
- **Minimum Position**: 10-15 shares for meaningful exposure
- **Maximum Allocation**: 80-110% based on technical confidence
- **Volume Constraint**: Minimum 15-25% of median daily volume

## üìà Performance Optimization Features

### Multi-Indicator Confluence
- **Requirement**: 3+ aligned signals for optimal trade quality
- **Weighting**: Each indicator contributes to overall score
- **Threshold**: Technical bonus only applied with 2+ confirmations

### Adaptive Exit Strategy
```python
# Priority-based exit logic
if high >= entry * trailing_trigger:
    exit_price = trailing_stop_exit
elif low <= stop_loss:
    exit_price = stop_loss
elif close >= fibonacci_618 and gain > 5%:
    exit_price = fibonacci_exit
elif technical_signal == 'strong_sell':
    exit_price = technical_exit
else:
    exit_price = close
```

### Real-time Parameter Adjustment
- **Bollinger Position**: Entry size adjustment based on band location
- **RSI Levels**: Profit requirement modification for oversold conditions
- **MACD Momentum**: Stop-loss tightening for strong trends
